# Anti-Hammer Exemptions..
# These spiders, at their correct IP Addresses, are exempt from Anti-Hammer.
#
# How-To..
#
# On the left, is the expected User Agent string (can be a partial match).
# On the right, is the file to look at for IP Mask information, one IP per line.
#
# Basically, you enter only as much of the string as is required to make a match.
# Entries are Case Sensitive. If you want to match "msnbot" and "MSNBOT", you 
# need two entries. Entries are read in order, and processing halts as soon as a
# match is found. See "Scooter" entries, below, for an example.
